                <p>In this event, participants will come in teams of two. A single code is divided into three parts. Each part will be coded in every round with the help of clues. Each team will be given the same set of clues which will include aptitude and logical reasoning questions. This will occur in rounds, first round will be of 15 mins, second round will be of 25 mins and third round will be of 35 mins. In each round the team has to solve the clue i.e. aptitude or logical reasoning question and do the coding, the team which is unable to do so will be eliminated round-wise. The team which is able to do the correct coding in the least time wins.
