Table tennis, also known as ping pong, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball back and forth across a table using small bats. The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as follows: players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table, and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once. A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. Play is fast and demands quick reactions. Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, giving the hitter a great advantage.
RULES:<ul>
<li>All games will be knockout games and fixtures will be released on the day of the event.</li>
<li>A point is scored when:</li>
an opponent fails to make a correct service,
an opponent fails to make a return,
the ball touches any part of an opponent’s body,
an opponent strikes the ball twice in succession,
if an opponent, or anything an opponent wears, touches the playing surface or net during play
<li>The game will be of 11 points.</li>
<li>Referees decision will be the final and binding.</li>
<li>Each player should report in proper sports kit.</li></ul>
